TODO for etched loops (electronics):

Make cassette slightly less harsh (soothe2) !
Make cue in even clearer !

Continue little embellishments (but note in score they’re not included)

Add in bass when it’s needed (either freq. domain. shift of materials or reese) !
Make moments of intensity go to (ping pong delay, reverb, amp sim, stereo spread, digitalis glitch) !

Add in sweeteners that enhance the reverb builds already present !

Louder bass drop in cool down time (+6 dB) !

Make ending bloops get louder, rather than quieter !
One other thing for ending: use low pass on sustained material, so that the repeated “bleep bleep” will pop !

TODO for etched loops (snare part):

The free sections (with the snare hits) are only times when not notated on single line !

Beginning starts as call and response, but moves to in-sync at first kick drum in !

Write out all time signatures first, then start putting in licks that match/work off of the electronics (these should be prescriptive rhythmically, not completely descriptive, with accents and dynamics as a way to suggest technique).
