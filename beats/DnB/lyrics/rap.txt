porcupine spines on the back
no terrier
the whole litter on the jet
no carrier
a pint of blood on the floor,
that's scarier
than taking off the shell
or the barrier

i said i wouldnt be the one
who chose to separate his life
from all the vulnerabilities of
children, family, home and strife

but yet i pick apart the pieces of the
annotated score and mark the leaderboard with 
numbers lower than before
