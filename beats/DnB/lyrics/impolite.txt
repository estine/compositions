Walking down the same street
That we met that Autumn night

Smile shining like a sunbeam
Every moment feeling right

Reached for your hand in my hand
And when I felt it I knew why

There are times when you just must be
Absolutely impolite

You're such a fucking cutie
My little Tirzah bear

You're such a fucking cutie
I want you everywhere
